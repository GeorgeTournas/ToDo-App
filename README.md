# ToDo App

This is a simple, but yet powerfull, to do list application. A very simple UI, gives you the ability to add a new task and set the desired date for it. Navigating through dates, the app loads all relevant tasks for this date.
You complete a task by clicking on the check box next to task name. To store tasks data, the project is using the local storage of the browser.

Created with HTML, CSS and plain Javascript.

Also have a look to other branches of ToDO App with API to store task data in an SQL batabase (Node.js and Express.js).
Upcoming development with Electron framework for using as a desktop app.
