# ToDo App API

This is a simple, but yet powerfull, to do list application. A very simple UI, gives you the ability to add a new task and set the desired date for it. Navigating through dates, the app loads all relevant tasks for this date.
You complete a task by clicking on the check box next to task name. 
To store tasks data, the project is using the Express framework and MySQL.

Also have a look to other branches of ToDO App in plain CSS, HTM and Javascript (task data storage in browser's localstorage).
Upcoming development with Electron framework for using as a desktop app.
